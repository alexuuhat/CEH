Scenario:
A mid-sized e-commerce company, SwiftBuy Inc., has suffered a ransomware attack, crippling its online operations. Employees report that files on critical servers have been renamed with a .fun extension, and a ransom note threatens to delete files every hour until payment is made. The attack has triggered panic, as SwiftBuy's customer database and financial records are at risk. The malware was likely introduced through a phishing email and has embedded itself within the system, encrypting files while persistently running in the background. As a Cyber Threat Analyst brought in by SwiftBuy's Incident Response team, your mission is to analyze the ransomware's behavior, locate the encryption routine, and halt the file deletion process before irreversible damage occurs. Your ultimate goal is to track the malware's execution, retrieve potential encryption/decryption keys, and develop a strategy to recover files without paying the ransom.

Description:
The infected machine is a Windows-based system. The challenge involves email analysis, forensic analysis, malware reverse engineering, and cryption techniques to fully understand and mitigate the attack.
